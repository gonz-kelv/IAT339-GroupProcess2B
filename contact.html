							<h3><a>Safety and Security:</a></h3>
								<p>Shopping with KLIDE.com is 100% safe and secure. We ensure that it’s safe by transferring 
								all of your personal information, including your name, address and credit card, over a Secure 
								Socket Layer (SSL) line. This ensures that your information is encrypted and cannot be read by
								others as it travels over the Internet. The secure mode begins when you initiate your order. 
								You will know you’re in secure mode when the tiny padlock icon (located at the bottom of your 
								browser) appears as “locked.” You also can verify you are in secure mode by looking at the URL
								line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address
								will change from “http” to “https.” And after the information reaches us, it is stored on a 
								secure server, resides behind a firewall and cannot be accessed from outside the company. At 
								that point, your information can only be accessed by employees to process your orders. We 
								guarantee every transaction as 100% safe and secure.
								</p>
							
							<h3>Exchanges and Returns:</h3>
								<p>At KLIDE we want you to be fully satisfied with your purchase. If, for any reason, you decide
								you would like to return an item, we accept returns in unworn, new condition for refund or 
								exchange. Orders have 30 days from the date of purchase to return items for exchange or refund.
								All footwear must be returned with the original, undamaged, unmarked KLIDE shoe box, inside of a 
								separate shipping box marked with the RMA#. Please note: Return shipping fees are the customer's 
								responsibility.
								</p>
							
							<h3>Internatinal Shipping:</h3>
								<p>International orders take 7 to 21 days to fulfill deliveries and may be subject to Customs 
								inspections which may affect the time of the delivery. Shipping charges are based on the weight
								of the item(s) shipped to the country of destination.
								</p>
								
							<h3>Duties, Customs and VAT:</h3>
								<p>International orders are subject to Duties, Customs and Value Added Taxes. These charges MUST
								be paid upon receipt of your order. Be sure to verify the additional cost you may incur with the
								authorities of the country the order is being shipped to.
								</p>
								
							<h3>Tax Policies:</h3>
								<p>We are required by State and Federal laws to charge sales tax on products and shipping charges
								of products shipped to states where we have physical stores: Vancouver.
								</p>
							
							<h3>Different Bill To & Ship To:</h3>
								<p>KLIDE uses several measures to protect our customers from fraud. One of these measures is to check
								if the shipping and billing addresses provided during checkout are the same. If these addresses do 
								not match, a customer service representative may contact the cardholder to verify the order legitimacy 
								prior to it being processed. In some cases, this may delay the order processing if we are not able to reach the cardholder immediately.
								</p>
