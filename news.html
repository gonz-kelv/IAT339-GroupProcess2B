						<p>SoCal footwear label introduces a new silhouette to its sneaker lineup ahead of the fall season. The all-new Frazier shoe utilizes a mix of traditional athletic
						elements and contemporary aesthetics, resulting in a stripped-back, minimalist design.
						The high-top’s upper is constructed premium leather and features tonal waxed nylon 
						lacing and neoprene accents with subtle branding placed at the tongue. Sitting atop
						of a molded EVA footbed for increased breathability and a rubber outsole, purchase a
						pair in a trio of stylish colorways for $150 USD from the brand’s webstore now. </p>

							<h3>DECEMBER 2015:THE KLIDE FRAZIER </h3>

					<div class="news-p">
								<p>The KLIDE Frazier is a subtle and minimalist looking high top that still manages to
								get the job done, and then some. Set to be a part of KLIDE’s Autumn/Winter, let’s take
								a closer look at what this high top has to offer. The Frazier is composed out of a 
								full grain leather upper that is the accented by the hits of suede and neoprene. The 
								upper will then be placed on an EVA footbed to make sure that you’re not just stylish, 
								but comfortable as well. Also placed underneath is KLIDE’s custom SP (Standard Premium) 
								protruding tread sole. Tonal laces along with a white midsole complete the look of the 
								high top Frazier. With your choice of either ruby, white or black, let us know which pair
								you’re looking forward to getting. </p>

									<p>Every once in a while we have to come home from the outdoors and class it up around town. 
									That doesn’t mean the experience should be painful, though. Just take the KLIDE Hamilton SP, for
									example. A super-clean leather upper with suede accents has you looking sharp, but a molded EVA
									footbed for breathability and a protruding tread for improved grip makes the Hamilton SP both 
									comfortable and functional, keeping feet happy without sacrificing that urban aesthetic.</p>
